                <strong>Obstacle avoidance car</strong>
                <p>Aug 2019 - Nov 2019</p>
                <p>We made an obstacle avoidance car using radar and Arduino. Arduino is a controller board which uses the ATmega microcontroller. To avoid such collisions, you need to detect the potential collision using radar sensor readings.</p>

                        <li>This innovative vehicle employs a servo mounted ultrasonic sensor to detect objects situated both in front and on either side of the car.</li>
                        <li>It sends out 40kHz ultrasonic signals that bounce back when they hit an object.</li>
                        <li>By analyzing the returning echoes, the sensor calculates distances between the car and obstacles in real-time.</li>
                        <li>When an obstacle is detected, the car autonomously changes direction.</li>

                <strong>Segment trees and its applications</strong>
                <p>Aug 2021 - Nov 2021</p>
                <p>We did Range update and lazy propagation in segment trees. Lazy propagation is a range update and query optimized implementation of a segment tree that performs both operations in O(logN) time. Segment tree or segtree is basically a binary tree used for storing the intervals or segments.</p>

                <strong>Exploratory data analysis on flower data</strong>
                <p>Aug 2022 - Nov 2022</p>
                <p>We did Logistic regression and KNN with different k to predict the different variety of flowers. By exploratory data analysis we mean understanding the variables and relationships between them.</p>
